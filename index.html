            <p><font face="arial" color="white">The Argentine superstar walked away from Camp Nou back in the summer of 2021 when a contract that <br>
                 Barca could not afford to extend came to a close. Messi headed for Paris Saint-Germain at that stage and <br>
                  spent two years in France before hitting free agency once more.</font></p>

            <h3><font face="arial" color="white">THE BIGGER PICTURE</font></h3>
            <p><font face="arial" color="white">He discussed a possible return to Barca with the club, but opted to take on an entirely new <br> challenge when heading to the United States to link up with Inter Miami. He has inspired <br> them to Leagues Cup glory, but an unfortunate injury has come at the worst possible time <br> and Messi may not figure in the 2023 MLS play-offs.</font></p>
            <h3><font face="arial" color="white">DID YOU KNOW?</font></h3>
                <p><font face="arial" color="white">His season would come to a close on October 21 if that is the case, leaving him with a lengthy <br> break through to the 2024 American season getting underway in February. It has been <br> suggested that Messi could – like David Beckham, Thierry Henry and Robbie Keane before <br> him – return to Europe on loan during the U.S. off season.</font></p>
